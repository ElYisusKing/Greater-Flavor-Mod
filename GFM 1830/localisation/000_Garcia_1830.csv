1833_reforms_title;The Reforms of 1833;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1833_reforms_desc;President Valentín Gomez Farias has proposed several social, political and economic reforms to curb the power of the Catholic Church in Mexico. Liberals compare the clergy to ministers of Huitzilopochtli (who received human sacrifices), accusing them of being being worldly, greedy hypocrites. They see the Bible as full of absurdities and falsehoods from an ignorant era and wish to disempower the pope. Conservatives are furious about the proposals and the disrespect to the church, seeing them as reason to depose Farias.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME183536;Las Siete Leyes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC183536;Our president's government has issued a new constitution called the 'Siete Leyes'. It replaces the constitution of 1824 and establishes the Centralist Republic of Mexico, a unitary state, strengthening the government in Mexico City. The federal system was originally implemented to emulate the success of the US, but evidently, as seen by the political turmoil and civil wars our country has experienced in the last decade, the federal system was a mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME183637;Separatist Movements Arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC183637;Disaster is sweeping the nation! Reports claim that, in response to the implementation of our constitution, many separatists rebellions have formed across the country, with the Texans declaring independence right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA183637;Fight those rebels! Defend the constitution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB183637;This is hopeless. There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44127OPTA;Our military could use the target practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44127OPTB;We shall surrender our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207010;The peoples in the south of our Kingdom are mainly Flemings and Walloons, Roman Catholics which are unhappy with how our government treats them, being subjugated by a mostly protestant north. Many liberals are claiming His Majesty King William I as a despotic ruler. Unemployemen and industrial unrest in the working classes has also contributed to the turmoil. Riots have erupted in Brussels, shops looted, Theatregoes joined the movement right after watching the nationalistic opera La muette de Portici. These rebels soon have started talking about seccesion and the States-General in brussels voted in favour of seccesion and declared independence. It's time to decide what are we going to do about this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207011;We have gloriously defeated the Dutch! Our independence has been secured and the Kingdom of Belgium has been born! Now we can appoint Leopold I as King of the Belgians and stablish an official government! Glory to Belgium! Glory to Flanders! Glory to Walloonia! Glory to the Kingdom of Belgium!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207012;The London Conference of $YEAR$ has been proclaimed. We have been invited to take a seat and discuss about the independence of Belgium. This is mostly a diplomatic settlement, as The Kingdom of Belgium is de facto independent. Nevertheless, we can get something from this, depending on what we choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207027;The State of Zacatecas has rebelled against our constitution. Francisco García Salinas, the governor of the state, is leading a small army of about four thousand men at the head of the revolt. To supress the rebellion, General Santa Anna has headed to Zacatecas with an army to handle the situation himself, leaving General Miguel Barragán as presidenct in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

mexican_securalization_law_desc;The Congress of the Union has proposed an Act to secularize all Californian missions, transferring ownership form the Franciscan Order of the Catholic Church to the Mexican authorities, this is because of potential Spanish influence and power in California because most Spanish missions in California are still loyal to the Roman Catholic Church in Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC4207028;After we were victorious in Spain's last attempt to reconquer Mexico in 1829, Anastasio Bustamante was put in charge of a reserve army which he used to revolt against president Vicente Guerrero. The revolt succeeded and Bustamante was recognized as president of the republic by congress today. Several deputies and liberal members of congress are furious at this, for in their view, Vicente Guerrero is the rightful legal president and in his absense, vice president José María Bocanegra should assume the presidency temporarily, meaning that Bustamante is a usurper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207029;Liberal general Juan José Codallos has risen up against Anastasio Bustamante's authoritarian presidency, organizing a rebel army in the West. Codallos has issued a proclamation with eleven articles, the most important of which is the restoration of Vicente Guerrero as the president of the Mexican Republic. The rebels are already on the move, taking hold of much of our western coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207030;In what many call 'the single most shocking event in the history of Mexico', Vicente Guerrero was captured in Acapulco through an act of betrayal. Guerrero was lured into a boat by an Italian merchant ship captain, Francisco Picaluga, and turned over to federal troops in Huatulco, where he was captured and tried in Oaxaca City. He has now been executed by the government. While this ends the movement to restore Guerrero to the presidency, the treacherous and brutal methods used have angered liberals throughout the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207031;Our glorious victory against the central government has restored Vicente Guerrero to the presidency! Mexico shall enter an era of peace, stability and prosperity with the new liberal reforms initiated by Guerrero and the liberal party. Guerrero has already issued several decrees concerning education, veteran's benefits and the construction of factories across the country to kickstart our industrialization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207032;Mexico has been suddenly wrought asunder by a devastating civil war. The instigators are the officers of the fort garrisons of Veracruz and San Juan de Ulúa who plot to re-establish the 1824 Federal Constitution. Their goal is to overthrow president Anastasio Bustamante and his conservative government and install Antonio López de Santa Anna as vice president with the liberals taking over the ministries and presidency to reverse the perceived damage done to our country by the conservatives. Although the officers are the leaders of the civil war, Santa Anna is the true covert mastermind at the root of it. The rebels initiated the civil war by captured a convoy loaded with money, ammunition and supplies. This gave them the material they needed to sustain their forces. The garrisons of Toluca, Tejupilco, Puebla, Guanajuato, Querétaro, Michoacán, Tlaxcala, Jalisco, Acapulco, Oaxaca and Aguascalientes have all joined the rebellion. Despite beginning as a small revolt, it has now truly engulfed our entire nation in a full-blown civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207033;Antonio López de Santa Anna, Anastasio Bustamante and Manuel Gómez Pedraza have signed an agreement in Puebla, dubbed 'The Zavaleta Conventions'. Under this treaty, Manuel Gómez Pedraza, a staunch liberal, has assumed the presidency of Mexico, restoring the constitutional order. The republican and federal systems are now re-empowered. While liberals across our country breathe a sigh of relief, the conservatives are morose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4207034;Manuel Gómez Pedraza's liberal reforms and anti-catholic rhetoric have infuriated the god-fearing religious people of Mexico. Using this uproar to move against Pedraza's government, Santa Anna was proclaimed as 'Protector of the Catholic Religion' and 'Sustainer of Religion and the Patriotic Liberties' by the clergy. With support from the church and the masses at its command, Santa Anna, Ignacio Echeverría and José Mariano Campos have proclaimed the Plan of Cuernavaca in the namesake town. They demand that the anti-ecclisiastic reforms be reversed and that Santa Anna be made president. More than 100 towns have already declared their support for the Plan of Cuernavaca. Santa Anna has published a manifesto to the people to gather further support in which he states that he is defending the wishes of the people by defending Catholicism and that he had 'implored' congress to end their anti-catholic policies -- to no avail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
