1833_reforms_title;The Reforms of 1833;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1833_reforms_desc;Valentín Gomez Farias has proposed several social, political and economic reforms to curb the power of the Catholic Church in Mexico. Conservatives will despise these reforms, seeing them as reason to depose Farias.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_oregon_territory_title;Claim the Oregon Country;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_oregon_territory_desc;The Oregon Country territory was first explored by Spanish explorers, who later discussed annexation of the territory at the Nutka Conventions. This history makes for solid justification to conquer Oregon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_luisiana_title;Claim the territory of Luisina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_luisiana_desc;The formal aquisition of the Louisiana Territory was declared by Spain in 1764, and the land integrated into the General Cuban Capitaincy of New Spain. Since the old Viceroyalty of New Spain was the predecessor to modern Mexico, our claim to Luisiana is still strong. It is time to take it for the glory of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_florida_title;Claim the Florida Peninsula;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_florida_desc;The Florida peninsula was the site of the first large-scale European settlement in continental North America. It later formed part of the General Cuban Capitaincy, which was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This naturally gives us a valid claim to the territory today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC183536;After president Valentín Gomez Farias implemented his liberal reforms in 1833, revoking power from the Church and military, conservatives have attempted to depose him and establish a new constitution. Farias's unpopularity has even caused his vice president, Antonio López de Santa Anna, to defect from him and join the coup, eventually taking power as the new Mexican president.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA183536;Santa Anna is a national hero. Put him in charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB183536;The church and state must stay separated. It's time for progress!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME183637;Separatist Movements Arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC183637;Disaster is sweeping the nation! Reports claim that, in response to the implementation of our constitution, many separatists rebellions have formed across the country--with the Texans declaring independence right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA183637;Fight those rebels! Defend the constitution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB183637;This is hopeless. There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44806;Antonio López de Santa Anna;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44806;A general and hero of the Mexican War of Independence, Santa Anna was elected president in 1833. After the deposition of the liberal president Valentín Gomez Farias, Santa Anna repealed the 1826 Constitution and took control of the country as a conservative dictator with Church and military backing. Many Mexican states objected to Santa Anna's centralization of power, creating a political crisis. With this combined with the rebellion of Tejas in the north, the entire country has fallen into chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT44127OPTA;Our military could use the target practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44127OPTB;We shall surrender our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
